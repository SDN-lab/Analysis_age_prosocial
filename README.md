Plots include:

- i) association between age and prosocial behaviour (including controlling for objective wealth and adjusting age for life expectancy)
- ii) age effects on prosocial behaviour in each of the 67 countries sampled
- iii) correlations of trait factor scores with age and with prosocial behaviour
- iiii) changes in COVID-19 death totals and death rates over the period of data collection

Analysis includes:

- i) mixed models of distancing and donation measures of prosocial behaviour
- ii) models controlling for country-level COVID-19 severity and country wealth
- iii) factor analysis on 19 individual difference measures and structural equation models
- iiii) control analyses
